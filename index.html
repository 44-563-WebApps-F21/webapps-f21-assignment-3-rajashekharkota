<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull">
    In geometry, the convex hull or convex envelope or 
    convex closure of a shape is the smallest convex set
     that contains it. The convex hull may be defined either
      as the intersection of all convex sets containing a 
      given subset of a Euclidean space, or equivalently as
       the set of all convex combinations of points in the 
       subset. For a bounded subset of the plane, the convex
        hull may be visualized as the shape enclosed by a 
        rubber band stretched around the subset.
